##REST GO API

This is a project of a REST API in GOLANG, connecting to a PostgreSql database.

The back-end of the project was done entirely in GO and has a connection to a front-end made in JavaScript.

This API shows personalities of the names of the streets.

To run this program, first you will have to add **node** dependencies, if you don't have node installed, you can download in this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

After downloading, run in the terminal of the project:

    npm install

    npm update

    npm start

*OBS: This will start the front-end

Now to run the GO code, just run:

    go run main.go

If you want to change something in the API, after running the program in your machine, enter in **Postman** and just add the URL of the API, by that, you will be able to make any CRUD action.
